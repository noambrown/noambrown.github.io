<p>I am a Research Scientist at FAIR (Meta) working on multi-agent artificial intelligence. My research involves reinforcement learning, planning, and computational game theory.</p>

<p>My teammates and I at FAIR developed <a href="downloads/diplomacy_science_all.pdf">CICERO</a>, the first AI to achieve human-level performance in the strategy game Diplomacy.</p>

<p>I have also applied my research to making the first AI to defeat <a href="https://qz.com/907896/how-poker-playing-ai-libratus-is-learning-to-negotiate-better-than-any-human/">top humans</a> in no-limit poker. With my CMU advisor, I created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libratus">Libratus</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/science/poker-robot-ai-artificial-intelligence.html">Pluribus</a>, which defeated top human poker professionals in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/how-computers-were-finally-able-to-best-poker-pros/2017/02/03/3d1fd8c8-e7fa-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html">Human vs. Machine competitions</a>. Libratus received the <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/awards/minsky_medal">Marvin Minsky Medal for Outstanding Achievements in AI</a>. Pluribus was on the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456">cover of Science Magazine</a> and was a <a href="https://vis.sciencemag.org/breakthrough2019/">runner-up for Science's Breakthrough of the Year for 2019</a>. I was also named one of MIT Tech Review's <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2019/visionary/noam-brown/">35 Innovators Under 35</a>.</p>

<p>I received a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon. Before CMU, I worked at the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve Board</a> in the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/ifgmsm-staff.htm">International Financial Markets</a> section, where I researched algorithmic trading in financial markets. Before that, I worked in algorithmic trading.</p>
